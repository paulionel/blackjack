Requirement Specifications
Get User Input:
Number of players, their bet, hit or hold, play again

Output:
Their bet, the dealers second card, their cards, all the dealers cards, if they win or lose, how much money they win or lose

System Anaylsis:
players wager > 5, if they have less that 5 dollars, players wager == left over value
players money += players wager if they win
players money -= players wager if they lose
if cardValue > 10 then cardValue = 10 (because jacks queens and kings are 10)
if cardValue == 1 then cardValue == 11 (because its an ace)
but if total value of hand > 21 then total value of hand -= 10 (because the ace is 1, and if its over 21 the car is worth only 1)
(I am not putting the math for the modules given to us by the professor)

System Design:
Import Deck
Import Time
Define Main
Create a list to hold the money
Ask for the amount of players
Depending on how many players, make the other players true or false.
Make a list the size of the number of players, and assign 100 to each spot
Make a variable to use in a while loop
Make a while loop
Define the deck
Define the hand
Add one to the amount of players, because the dealer needs to be in the list
Make a list of lists ( multidimensional list )
Make a list for the wagers
Ask for player ones bet
Make a while loop
Print how much money they have and ask for a bet
Add that bet to the list
If the bet is less than five, ask them to reenter unless they have less than five.
If their bet is over their amount of money, tell them to reenter.
Do that for all players playing.
Draw a card for each player, one at a time.
Print the second card in the dealers hand
Make a while loop
Get the value of their hand
Show them their hand and its value
Ask if they want to hit or hold
If they hit, add a card
If it busts, tell them and break the loop
If they hold, break the loop
Do for all players
Make a while loop
Get the value of the dealers hand
Show the dealers hand and the value of their hand
time.sleep
If they have less than 17, draw a card until its 17 or over
If they bust exit the loop
If they have over 17, hold
time.sleep
get the sum of the players hand
get the sum of the dealers hand
if the sum of the players hand is over 21, they bust
if the dealer also busted, let them know they both busted
subtract the wager from the total
if they have no money, take them out of the game
if the dealer busted, but they didn't, tell them they won
add the wager money to the total
if the players hand is less than 21, but over the dealers hand they win
add the wager to the total
if they have less than the dealer, they lose
subtract the wager from the total
if they have the same, they tie
nothing happens to the total
if they have no money, take the player out of the game and inform them
do for all the players
Make a for loop printing the remainder of the money left for each player
If all the players are out of the game, exit
If there is a player left over, ask if they want to play again
If they want to play again, start again.
If they want to leave, sort the list, do multiple if statements, then exit()
Define getHandValue
Give it a list and a value
Make a value called sum = 0
Make a for list that goes through in card in the multidimensional, at the list at spot value
Make a temp value equal the value of the point on that list
If it is over 10, make it equal to ten (face cards)
If it is 1, make it equal eleven (aces)
Add the temp value to the value of the sum
If the sum is finished and over 21, see if there was a value that equaled one
If there was, subtract 10, because Ace's are only worth 1 if the total value of the cards is over 21.
Return the sum
Call main
